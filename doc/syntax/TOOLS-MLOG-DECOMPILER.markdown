# Mlog Decompiler

The Mlog Decompiler allows to **partially decompile** an existing mlog file into Mindcode. The resulting file cannot be compiled by Mindcode right away, but needs to be manually edited to create loops, conditional statements, functions and other high-level control structures that may be directly or indirectly present in the original mlog.

The decompiler is mainly useful to produce expressions and function calls in the correct Mindcode syntax, saving some time and possibly helping to avoid some mistakes
compared to a manual rewrite of the entire mlog code from scratch.

Mlog can be decompiled by both the [command line tool](TOOLS-CMDLINE.markdown) and the [web application](http://mindcode.herokuapp.com/mlog-decompiler).
