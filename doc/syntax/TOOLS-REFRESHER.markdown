# Schematics Refresher

Schematics Refresher is a Mindustry mod that can be found on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/cardillan/SchematicsRefresher).

You can install this mod by creating a `SchematicsRefresher` subdirectory in the `Mindustry/mods` directory, and 
copying the files from the above repository there. Then you can place new schematic built by Schematics Builder 
(possibly automating this task using the [Command line tool](TOOLS-CMDLINE.markdown)). The mod will ensure all 
schematic from this directory are loaded into Mindustry when the game starts, and also allows you to use the 
**Refresh** button in the **Schematics** screen to reload all schematics even when the game is running.

At this moment, new tags won't appear in the **Schematics** screen filter until the screen is closed and reopened. 
Also, if you had a filter active, you need to activate or deactivate it to update list of displayed schematics 
matching the filter.

See [Mindustry Modding Guide](https://simonwoodburyforget.github.io/mindustry-modding/) if you have trouble 
installing the mod - or ask a question here on GitHub.
