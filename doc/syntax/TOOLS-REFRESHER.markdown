# Schematics Refresher

> [!NOTE]
> The Schematics Refresher has been deprecated. Mlog Watcher provides better functionality for injecting schematics into the game.

Schematics Refresher is a Mindustry mod that can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cardillan/SchematicsRefresher).

You can install this mod by creating a `SchematicsRefresher` subdirectory in the `Mindustry/mods` directory, and copying the files from the above repository there. Then you can place a new schematic built by Schematic Builder (possibly automating this task using the [Command line tool](TOOLS-CMDLINE.markdown)). The mod will ensure all schematics from this directory are loaded into Mindustry when the game starts. When the game is running, you can use the **Refresh** button in the **Schematics** screen to reload all schematics.

At this moment, new tags won't appear in the **Schematics** screen filter until the screen is closed and reopened. Also, if you had a filter active, you need to activate or deactivate it to update the list of displayed schematics matching the filter.

See [Mindustry Modding Guide](https://simonwoodburyforget.github.io/mindustry-modding/) if you have trouble installing the mod—or ask a question here on GitHub.
