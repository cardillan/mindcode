    description = """
        Creates metaglass from scrap. Typically utilizes the kiln fully,
        albeit sometimes not enough lead may be produced by separators.
        While the scrap consumption fluctuates, about 11.5 scrap per second is consumed on average.
        First output produces 2 metaglass per second, second output produces copper, titanium and graphite
        at a variable rate.
        Sand or lead is never produced by the factory.
