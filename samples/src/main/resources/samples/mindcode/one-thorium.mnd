// To use this script, build a thorium reactor and attach it to a processor
// with this code. The reactor will be linked to the processor as reactor1.

// This script then checks that the cryofluid level is at least on 25% of the reactor capacity.
// If it isn't, the reactor is disabled, preventing a blow up.

reactor1.enabled = reactor1.@cryofluid >= 0.25 * reactor1.@liquidCapacity;
