     4 instructions before optimizations.
     1 instructions eliminated by Single Step Elimination (3 iterations).
     3 instructions after optimizations.

Modifications by Final phase, Single Step Elimination, iteration 1 (-1 instructions):
     0 write 10 bank1 0
     1 read __tmp0 bank1 0
     2 print __tmp0
-    * end

Final code before resolving virtual instructions:

write 10 bank1 0
read __tmp0 bank1 0
print __tmp0
