    12 instructions before optimizations.
     2 instructions eliminated by Temp Variables Elimination.
     1 instructions eliminated by Single Step Elimination (4 iterations).
     4 instructions eliminated by Data Flow Optimization (6 iterations).
     5 instructions after optimizations.

Final code before resolving virtual instructions:

set value 1
op add A value 1
op add __tmp1 A A
print __tmp1
print __tmp1
