     6 instructions before optimizations.
     1 instructions eliminated by Single Step Elimination (4 iterations).
     5 instructions after optimizations.

Modifications by Jumps phase, Single Step Elimination, pass 2, iteration 1 (-1 instructions):
 
     3 read *tmp0 bank1 0
     4 assertequals 10 *tmp0 "value from memory"
     5 stop
-    * end

Final code before resolving virtual instructions:

label *label0
jump *label0 equal bank1 null
write 10 bank1 0
read *tmp0 bank1 0
assertequals 10 *tmp0 "value from memory"
stop
