     5 instructions before optimizations.
     1 instructions eliminated by Single Step Elimination (5 iterations).
     4 instructions after optimizations.

Modifications by Jumps phase, Single Step Elimination, pass 3, iteration 1 (-1 instructions):
 
     1 read *tmp1 bank1 0
     2 assertequals 10 *tmp1 "value from memory"
     3 stop
-    * end

Final code before resolving virtual instructions:

write 10 bank1 0
read *tmp1 bank1 0
assertequals 10 *tmp1 "value from memory"
stop
